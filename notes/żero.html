        <h1>David's Maltese Notes</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my notes from learning Maltese!</p>

        <p>These pages will have two purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To serve as notes for me while I learn Maltese.</li>
            <li>To serve as lessons for you while you learn Maltese (from English).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>I'm not a native speaker of Maltese.</b> I speak English, and
            Arabic, Hebrew, Italian, and Spanish to varying degrees. So
            use these lessons with a grain of salt.
        </p>

        <div class="info">
            <p>I will add a Table of Contents here once I write enough 
                lessons!
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>What Maltese is Like</h2>

        <p>Maltese is a Semitic language. That means it is more closely related
            to Arabic and Hebrew than it is to Italian or any other language. This is great news for me,
            but probably less great news for you. 
        </p>

        <p> However, 
            more than 50% of the Maltese vocabulary derives from Italian, and
            only around 30% derives from Arabic. Assuming you know English
            or a Romance language and not a Semitic language, <b>the hard part 
            will be the grammar, not the vocabulary.</b>
        </p>

        <p>Fortunately, Maltese grammar is actually very simple!
            At least compared to Arabic and Hebrew. There are not many
            verb conjugations, and they are easy to memorize. Here are what
            I predict will be the hard parts (unless you speak Arabic):
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A lot of the time, the plural form of a noun will not be
                predictable from the singular form. Think <i>mouse</i> and 
                <i>mice</i>. 
            </li>
            <li> If you don't speak a language with grammatical gender,
                remembering and using gender in Maltese will be tough. 
            </li>
            <li>The syntax (word order) of Maltese is often different from English.</li>
        </ul>

        
    <h2>Why I'm Writing Out These Notes</h2>

        <p>I've realized over the past few years that I personally learn best 
            by writing out what I'm learning for others. Also, I was really inspired by
            <a href="https://mun.la/sona/open.html">jan Kekan San's course on 
            Toki Pona</a>, weird as that might sound. I think his course has a
            learning style that really, really works for me, and I'm excited
            to make use of it here :)</p>
